It <em>is</em> confusing at first.</p>\n<p>But I’ve also come to see it not as a flaw of Hooks but as a mismatch between the <a href=\"/react-as-a-ui-runtime/\">React programming model</a> and <code class=\"language-text\">setInterval</code>. Hooks, being closer to the React programming model than classes, make that mismatch more prominent.</p>\n<p><strong>There <em>is</em> a way to get them working together very well but it’s a bit unintuitive.</strong></p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll look at <em>how</em> to make intervals and Hooks play well together, <em>why</em> this solution makes sense, and which <em>new</em> capabilities it can give you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: this post focuses on a <em>pathological case</em>. Even if an API simplifies a hundred use cases, the discussion will always focus on the one that got harder.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re new to Hooks and don’t understand what the fuss is about, check out <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this introduction</a> and the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a> instead. This post assumes that you worked with Hooks for more than an hour.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"My First Gatsbyjs Blog Post","date":"October 30, 2019","spoiler":"How I Setup gatsbyjs to make a blog"},"fields":{"slug":"/my-first-gatsbyjs-blog-post/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/my-first-gatsbyjs-blog-post/","previous":null,"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
