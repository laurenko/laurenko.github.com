date: '2019-10-30'
spoiler: Hello world!

I'm always aspire to write and share my experience in writing to those who are interested.
Been doing it with jekyll, blogspot, etc. however not once I can push my self to regularly writing a blog post.

This time, as part of my new learning using gatsbyjs, I have decided to start again another blog in github pages.

```js
if (__DEV__) {
  doSomethingDev();
} else {
  doSomethingProd();
}
